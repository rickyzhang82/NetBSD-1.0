Changes 2.20 -> 3.00                                                  March 1994
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Release 3.00

- last minute patch from Joerg (pcvt_hdr.h, BugList, NotesAndHints)

- included speedup patch from Michael Havemester as Etc/LAST-MINUTE

- updated Doc/pcvt.4

- removed bug in Util/ispcvt/Makefile which caused ispcvt to be installed
	into /usr/sbin and /usr/local/bin

- split ioctl VGAPCVTID into two: intro of ioctl VGAPCVTINFO for compile
	time options only.
	VGAPCVTID is now frozen for identification purposes (XFree86 3.0)
	updated Util/ispcvt for the above mentioned changes

- issued patch to upgrade beta14 to beta16

- bugfix: when scrolling up (bcopy) is interrupted by a keystroke requesting
	a change of the current screen, the "new" screen is scrolled up. Fixed
	in pcvt_kbd.c and pcvt_out.c (check_scroll)

- fixed bug "Jumping through vt's with ALT-F12 does jump over vt0"

- PCVT_PCBURST intro, update of ioctl and Util/ispcvt

- NetBSD speedup patch from Michael Havemester (factor 6-10)

- issued patch to upgrade beta14 to beta15 (never officially announced)

- added patch for ttioctl parameters NetBSD-current 12 Feb 94 from Michael
	Havemester in pcvt_drv.c

- INSTALLATION.xxx(x)BSD upgraded to reflect changes in Util and NetBSD-current

- struct pcvtid changed to hold the value of PCVT_xxx(x)BSD, ispcvt upgraded

- applied patch from Szabolcs Szigeti for 132 column operation  for Trident
	TVGA 8900B and TVGA8900C based boards

- PCVT_NETBSD can/must now be 1 or 09 for Release 0.9 and > 09 for current

- applied patches from John Brezak and Szabolcs Szigeti for recent 
	NetBSD-current changes (syscframe -> trapframe)

- in Util, removed Makefile.inc. Make Makefile.inc.FreeBSD and
	Makefile.inc.NetBSD and added a check to the toplevel and every
	other Makefile in this part of the tree. sigh ...

- patch from Joerg for pcvt.4 Makefile and Debugger in FreeBSD

- issued pcvt-beta14, code freeze for 3.00 release, just bugfixes now

- INSTALLATION.FreeBSD and a small cleanup patch from Joerg

- large patch from Joerg to get pcvt FreeBSD-current compliant

- permisssion/owner cleanup, files:664, dirs:775, user:root, group:wheel

- got rid of the verbose error message when installing in Util/fonts

- new make-method in Util/kcon to workaround make portability problems

- NetBSD-current detection workaroundaroundaround for NEW_AVERRUNNABLE in
	pcvt_header.h

- MONO_BUF and COLOR_BUF now ifndef'ed

- fixed typo in pcvt_kbd.h in cfkey11() and cfkey12()

- machine/pio.h must be included in pcvt_hdr.h for recent NetBSD-current 

- protected every tsleep call with an "if(curproc)" otherwise there is
	chance to panic the system (Joerg has an idea why ...)

- more fixes from Joerg: keyboard scansets fixed, X server is now aware
	of redefined keys (ioctl implemented)

- patch from Heiko Rupp, configuration with XSERVER not defined didn't	compile

- new version of vgaio from Joerg installed

- large keyboard cleanup patch from Joerg merged in

- bugfixes from Joerg: fix crash on not-open vt, remove pcxint, add option
  PCVT_INHIBIT_NUMLOCK (for notebook owners :-), support for EGA/VGA
  fonts with up to 32 scanlines.

- included vgaio, a program to read/write vga register values from Joerg.

- included mcon, the keyboard mouse emulator control program from Joerg.

- applied averunnable patch to satisfy the most recent NetBSD-current.

- fixing cursor not updated bug if usl/vt server is running on vt0

- polished some chars in Util/fonts/vt220l.810, fixed all permissions in
	the uuencoded fontfiles.

- debugged the EGA/VGA curses based font editor 'fed' in Util/fed. It seems
	it's working ok now now.

- updated copyright header files

- synchronize asynchronous cursor position update with having a valid
	(new) cursor (row) position from sputc(). (Otherwise a cursor
	would appear temporarily in the first position of the first
	function key label in the HP mode)

- updated screeninfo ioctl and scon to report the monitor type

- added file Doc/Notes for random notes and hints for pcvt-users.

- enhanced the pcvtid-ioctl and the ispcvt(8) utility to print out the
	values of all "PCVT_XXXXXX" compile time options.

- included work from Joerg to convert all ifdef's to if's, to be able
	to compile various configurations of pcvt without changing
	options in the header file.

- included (currently untested !) patch for a keyboard mouse emulator
	from Joerg. (he got problems after he bought a notebook with
	just one serial port, which he wanted to use for slip ...)

- screensaver reset is now also done asyncronously to get more speed. the
	function average() was renamed to async_update().

- cursor position update and cursor position display in HP mode is now done
	asynchronously in function average() in pcvt_sup.c. the function
	update_cursor does no longer exist. this gave about 10..30% increase
	in speed depending on the data cat'ed (termcap, kernel, 1Mb nulls)

- HP function key emulation processing debugged, this has to be rewritten
	to use a stack and a new parser. elm -K now works a bit more, the
	display is not garbled anymore, but fkey strings do not work.

- pcvt_vtf.c split off from pcvt_out.c, file got > 100k. Checked all
	forward declarations in header and source files

- 132 column support for Cirrus Logic CL-GD542X chipsets written by
	Onno van der Linden, c/o vdlinden@fwi.uva.nl

- keyboard scancode display	(#define PCVT_SHOWKEYS)

- printscreen keycode fix form Onno van der Linden

- Util/Makefile.inc added .depend dependency for make depend

- pcvt_ioctl.h is now installed into /usr/include/machine.

- keyboard scancode 1 is now used by default, perhaps it cures some problems

- support for keyboard scancodes sets 1 and 2 (compile time selectable via
	PCVT_SCANSET), patch from Onno van der Linden, c/o vdlinden@fwi.uva.nl

- Util/fontedit.c updated to "#if defined (__386BSD__) || defined (__NetBSD__)"
	(suggested by Mark Weaver, Mark_Weaver@brown.edu)

- 132 column support for S3 86c928 chipsets

- split off pcvt_ext.c from pcvt_sup.c, it was more than 100k ....

- intro of Doc/Manifest and Doc/TestedHardware, removed README.X-PATCH because
	it was now really outdated

- superprobe compatibility patches from Joerg

- intro of file Doc/BugList

- another powerpatch from Joerg:
	- some vgaioctl's are now available if in X mode (i.e. to scon to 
		another screen from within an xterm)
	- removed bug in keyboardhandling, numlock'ed numkeys did send an
		additional null (0x00) char, this has been fixed now.
	- SysRq key made functional

- made force 24 lines (see below) the default configuration to have a well
	behaving vt220 emulator at startup.

- every vt now has a separate caps-lock, num-lock and scroll-lock flag and
	a separate handling of these lock-keys.

- made sleeping in case of scroll lock working from an earlier patch from Joerg.

- large patch from Joerg:
	- Doc/pcvt.4 updated to reflect recent changes
	- struct winsize set ok when switching between HP/VT
	- struct winsize pixels reflect real values now
	- ioctl for switching between 80 and 132 cols
	- 132 columns for generic VGA's	
	- updated scon to provide access to ioctl 80/132 col switching 

- removed pcconcoftc and kbdsoftc structures from header files, removed
	pcconsintr variable and introduced kbd polling synchronization
	varaible kbd_polling.

- merging Joerg's patch to support 132 columns on Tseng Labs ET3000

- moved  Util/uemacs/* --> Etc/uemacs.tar.Z.uu

- added patches from Joerg for new Makefiles in Util

- added keyboard security define's to the new X server code

- adding bugfixes from Joerg Wunsch for "old" (= non vt switching) X server

- Control-Alt-Functionkey(1...12) switches now virtual screens/terminals to
	behave consistently with xfree 2.0, also the pages are now checked
	against the real no. of terminals available ALL the time ...

- pcvt_hdr.h: changed "int pcstart();" to "void pcstart();" to avoid warning
	message when compiling under NetBSD-current

- Doc dir split into Doc and Etc, Support renamed to Util

- adding NetBSD-current support for new X server support (syscframe changed 
	to trapframe in NetBSD-current as of 11/11/93)

- adding Joergs changes for XFree86 2.0 multiple X server and/or terminal
	session support

- adding entries from patchkit 0.2.4 codrv keymap to Support/keycap/keycap.src

- Keyboard security introduced into the XSERVER dependent part in pcvt_drv.c

- renamed device files from /dev/ttycXX to /dev/ttyvXX

- added file Doc/pcvt.el from Joerg Wunsch to distribution

- added HP-mode function key map from Gordon L. Burditt to description
	in Doc/Keyboard.HP

- fixed bug in scon which prevents it from showing the correct status of
	132 column support of chipset

- 132 column mode for Trident TVGA9000 works now, after 2 1/5 months of 
	calling everybody i eventually got a tech ref manual from Trident .... 

- it is now possible to "force" pcvt into a 24 line mode when operating
	in pure VT mode with 25 lines or in HP mode with 28 lines. This
	is sometimes necessary when running software which assumes it runs
	on a "real" VT220 which has just 24 lines.

- updated scon to support the 24 lines force mode (scon -f [ on | off ])

- soft reset fkey now positions cursor into left upper corner, update_cursor()
	made global function

- updated scon (-l) to print out additional info about the vga chipset,
	family and 132 column support if VGA detected.

- added additional fields to screeninfo structure in pcvt_ioctl.h to be
	able to return information about current vga chipset.

- moved VGA type/family definitions from pcvt_hdr.h to pcvt_ioctl.h

- Terminfo and Termcap updated to support 132 columns

- fixed bug in kcon which outputs garbage for remapped keys in kcon -l.
	(reported by Gordon L. Burditt, gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org)

- modified Makefile for Support/ispcvt to copy it for installation instead
	of moving it ..

- renamed /usr/share/misc/keycap -> /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt to
	avoid nameclash with same file for codrv (Gordon Burditt)

- security bit no longer ignored when initializing keyboard (see #define
	PCVT_USEKBDSEC in pcvt_hdr.h, suggested by Terry Lambert)

- cpufunc.h include made only for NetBSD (Gordon Burditt)

- switch statement in pcvt_drv.c removed for 386BSD (Gordon Burditt)

- Trident cursor size bug removed

- keyboard initialization for ddb

- added support for cursor on/of switching, screensaver and DECTCEM

- Change Support/Makefile to use <bsd.subdir.mk> instead of <bsd.prog.mk>

- Font editor for the EGA/VGA font-files added to support the design of new
  fonts. One will need Zeyd M. Ben-Halim's ncurses library to compile it, see
  file README.FIRST for information where to get it

- Doc/INSTALLATION upgraded

- Terminfo entry added to support Zeyd M. Ben-Halim's ncurses port

- ispcvt is now installed in /sbin to have it at boottime if /usr is not
	yet mounted.

- applied a patch which prevents CAPS LOCK, SHIFT LOCK, and SCROLL LOCK
	from being repeated (causing i.e a flashing CAPS LOCK led while
	holding CAPS LOCK key down).
	(diff from Gordon L. Burditt, gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org)

- merging patches to support the pccons-model of X11 server support
	(diff from Joerg Wunsch, joerg_wunsch@uriah.sax.de)

- file pcvt_drv.c routine pg() enclosed in "#ifdef PCVT_PREPATCH022" to solve
	multiple defined symbols beginning with patchkit 0.2.2
	(reported by Marko Karppinen, dreamer@purkki.apu.fi)

- added british keycap entry into keycap source file
	(from Andy Duplain, duplain@rtf.bt.co.uk)


Changes 2.00 -> 2.10                                                  March 1993
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- detecting the presence of video boards has been changed to ask the 
  BIOS "equipment byte" in the RTC-CMOS ram what's installed. this caused
  many discussions but solved also many problems ....

- driver name changed from "pc" to "vt" for multiple driver coexistence
	(diff from Joerg Wunsch, joerg_wunsch@uriah.sax.de)

- new devicenames recommended for showup in utils like "ps"
	(many people suggested that ..)

- new location for manual pcvt.0
	(diff from Joerg Wunsch, joerg_wunsch@uriah.sax.de)

- new demo file "sgr.vt" to show available graphic renditions

- intro of Doc/ChangeLog (this file)

- fixed bug in Support/keycap/Makefile
	(diff from Gordon L. Burditt, gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org)

- make vttest (main.c) compile after applying patchkit-beta2

- screensaver fixed by Joerg Wunsch

- screensaver now compiled in by default

- made recognition of CONTROL-ALT-DELETE an optional #ifdef'ed feature

- added sgr-conversion table for MDA adaptors

- fixed sgr-conversion table for VGA monochrome environments

- added support for using the kernel debugger
	(diff from Bruce Evans, bde@runx.oz.au)

- fixed several bugs regarding monochrome environments in pcvt_sup.c

- fixed bug in scon preventing one from piping output though more
	(reported by Gordon L. Burditt, gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org)

- display current screen number in HP-mode in the bottom right of screen

- changed names of all #define-able compile time options to start with
  "PCVT_" for easy identification and installation into the kernel config file

- applied another pcvt_kbd.c patchkit from Bruce Evans, bde@runx.oz.au. he
  writes:

	These fixes are mainly related to ddb.  sgetc has a weird interface that
	has caused some bugs, and it was too easy for ddb to reenter itself.
	
	1. Don't use char for keypad2num, char might be unsigned.  Space is not
	   important since the array is small.
	
	2. Don't use u_short for n.
	
	3. Change some 0's to NULLs.
	
	4. sgetc must not return NULL for the !noblock case.  Only callers with
	   noblock set check for the null pointer.  When the kernel follows a
	   null pointer, I think page 0 is sometimes mapped in so nothing bad
	   happens.  The kernel panics if the page is not mapped in.
	
	5. Reentrancy fix. The debugger really ought to check for reentrancy
	   itself, but the driver still needs to return early after the 
	   debugger returns, so that it doesn't return a junk ESC from
	   ctrl-alt-ESC.
	
	6. xlatkey2ascii may return NULL too.
