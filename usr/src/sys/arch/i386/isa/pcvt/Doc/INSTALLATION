(5) you have the choice of two keyboard layouts regarding the placement of
    the vt220 function keys and the HELP and DO keys.

    both configurations are documented in the files Keyboard.HP and Keyboard.VT
    respectively.

    decide which one to use and set the "#define" of PCVT_VT220KEYB to 
    compile the one you choosed.          (see also pcvt_hdr.h and pcvt_kbd.c)

(6) there are several other configuration "#define"-able options located at
    the beginning of pcvt_hdr.h. "user"-settable options all start with "PCVT_".
    Please (!!!) read the comments for them in the header file !

(8) edit your kernel configuration file and comment the following line out
    by placing a "#" in front of it:

      device     pc0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector pcrint

    add a new config-line just below it:

      device     vt0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector pcrint

    the lines in my config file look like this:

      #device    pc0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector pcrint
      device     vt0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector pcrint

    you can use now either the pccons driver or the pcvt driver (or possibly
    other console drivers too!) by simply un-commenting ONE of them.

    YOU CANNOT USE/UNCOMMENT MORE THAN __ONE__ CONSOLE DRIVER !!!

(9) configure a new kernel using config(8).

(10) run "make depend" for the new kernel !!!!

     (if you upgrade from a previous version of pcvt, or get unresolved
      symbols during step 11, it may be necessary to run a "make clean"
      prior to running "make depend" !!)

(11) compile the new kernel

(12) test the new kernel (i.e. on a floppy) and check whether it still works
     with your keyboard and your videoboard.

     if the kernel works, install it on your harddisk and reboot.

(13) change into the distribution subdirectory "Util".
     Edit Makefile.inc to suit your needs, especially have a look at "MANDIR"
     and "BINDIR". then execute "make". this makes all the utilities in their
     directories. when you are satisfied with the results, execute "make
     install". this installs all programs in all subdirs in "BINDIR" and all
     manual pages in "MANDIR", all fonts in "FONTDIR" and the keycap database
     in "CAPDIR".

     change into the distribution subdirectory "Doc" and edit Makefile
     to suit your needs. then execute "make" to prepare the manpage for
     the driver.

(14) if necessary, edit /usr/share/misc/keycap to match your keyboard.
     keycap uses special codes which are documented in Util/kcon/keycap.3
     and Util/kcon/keycap.5. also have a look at Util/kcon/kcon.1.

(15) there are example termcap entries for the various screen resolutions
     in the file "Doc/Termcap". integrate them into your termcap file if
     you don't have a "normal" vt220 entry or want to use pcvt's extensions.

     NOTE: pcvt works with an unmodified VT220 termcap entry !
	   (it was written to do that .... ;-)
	
(16) to use the virtual terminals, one must "mknod" this devices, they have 
     major number 12 and minor numbers 0 to n:

	mknod /dev/ttyv0 c 12 0
	mknod /dev/ttyv1 c 12 1
	mknod /dev/ttyv2 c 12 2
	mknod /dev/ttyv3 c 12 3
	...
	mknod /dev/ttyv<n> c 12 <n>

     There is a shell-script available (Doc/MAKEDEV.pcvt) for this purpose.

     ls -l in my /dev directory looks like this:

	crw-------    1 root       0,   0 Nov 12 15:55 /dev/console
	crw-rw----    1 root      12,   0 Aug 12 21:13 /dev/ttyv0
	crw-------    1 root      12,   1 Nov 12 14:11 /dev/ttyv1
	crw-------    1 root      12,   2 Nov 12 14:11 /dev/ttyv2
	crw-------    1 root      12,   3 Nov 12 14:11 /dev/ttyv3

(17) edit /etc/ttys to enable login on the virtual consoles, mine looks like
     this:
	
	ttyv0	"/usr/libexec/getty console"	pcvt25h	on secure
	ttyv1	"/usr/libexec/getty console"	pcvt25h	on secure
	ttyv2	"/usr/libexec/getty console"	pcvt25h	on secure
	ttyv3	"/usr/libexec/getty console"	pcvt25h	on secure
	

(18) because the driver is (mostly) 8-bit clean, the entry to be used with it
     in /etc/gettytab has to contain a ":np:" (no parity) entry, the "default"
     entry has a ":ap:" (any parity), if you want to use this entry, you have
     to change the ":ap:" to ":np:"!
     my default entry looks like this:

	default:\
		:np:fd#1000:im=\r\n   386BSD (%h) (%t)\r\n\r\n:sp#9600:


(19) edit /etc/rc.local to download fonts and establish emulation modes, mine
     looks like the example provided in Doc/rc.local


good luck !
