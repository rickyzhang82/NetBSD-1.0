---------	---------------------------------------------------------------

loadfont	Program to download charactersets into EGA/VGA character
		generator memory.

cursor		Very simple program to set the cursor shape.

scon		Program to control various aspects of terminal emulation,
		such as: emulation mode, screen switching etc.

kcon		Program to control various aspects of the keyboard such as
		key remapping for national keyboards etc.

keycap		A library for accessing the keycap database

ispcvt		A short program usable in shell scripts to verify that the
		current running kernel has pcvt compiled in and that the
		the utility version and the driver version are the same.

fontedit	A program to edit VT220 downloadable character sets.

userkeys	A program to edit the VT220 programmable function keys.

fonts		Contains uuencoded binary fontfiles following the naming rule:

				vt220<X>.<YYY>.uu

		<X> can be 'l' or 'h', where 'l' stands for a standard
			IBM II charset and is to be loaded first for the
			base characterset to support a desired resolution,
			and 'h' is the extended characterset needed for proper
			VT220 emulation and is to be loaded as the second set
			in addition to the above mentioned base characterset.

		<YYY> is the identifier for the character cell size, currently
			we have:
			808 = 8x8  - 50 lines on VGA, 43 lines on EGA
			810 = 8x10 - 40 lines on VGA
			814 = 8x14 - 28 lines on VGA, 25 lines on EGA
			816 = 8x16 - 25 lines on VGA

		Files distributed:

		vt220l.808.uu, vt220h.808.uu
		vt220l.810.uu, vt220h.810.uu
		vt220l.814.uu, vt220h.814.uu
		vt220l.816.uu, vt220h.816.uu

		The next two are just for reference, or to design new fonts but
		of no real other use:

		vt100pc.814.uu - Uudecoded binary fontfile containing an 
			8x14 font with special display functions at 0x00..0x1f

		vt100sg.814.uu - Uudecoded binary fontfile containing an 
			8x14 font with special display functions at 0x00..0x1f,
			a special graphics char set at 0x1f..0x7f and
			a supplemental graphics char set at 0x80..0xff

vttest		A VT100 compatibility tester. This is a test tool for
		VT100 emulation writers and terminal buyers.

demo		- chardemo.vt and colors.vt: These two files are from the
		  MSDOS-Kermit distribution from the Columbia University.
		  They can be "cat"-ed to the terminal screen and display
		  all supported VT220 charactersets and all possible colors
		  respectively.
		- sgr.vt: A demonstration of the various display enhancement
		  combinations for the DECSGR escape sequence.

fed		- a simple, System V curses based font-editor for the EGA/VGA
		  fonts in the above mentioned font - directory.
		  Fed was developed using Zeyd M. Ben-Halim's ncurses library,
		  which is avilable by ftp from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/.

mcon		- a program to control the mouse emulation via the keyboard

vgaio		- a program to read and write VGA registers. CAUTION: because
		  you are able to change the timings without check or warning,
		  this program may permanently damage your monitor. If you
		  don't know what you are doing, DO NOT USE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
