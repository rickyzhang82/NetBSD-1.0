Notes on the NetBSD/da30 port.
------------------------------

This directory contains a port of NetBSD to the DA-30, a single-board
computer based on the MC68030 microprocessor.  There is exactly one
DA-30 in existence: it's the wire-wrap prototype of a robot
controller.  Unfortunately the local company making the robots that I
designed the DA-30 for stopped making robots and started importing them
instead :-(.  So I added some disk and a graphics interface, and now
it's my home system.  This port won't be directly applicable to
anybody else's machine, but I hope it will be useful as an example;
perhaps some of the drivers may be useful to somebody also.

This system differs from "traditional" NetBSD in that one hard disk
has a sector size of 1024 bytes rather than 512.  The file "patches"
in this directory contains modifications to miscfs/specfs/spec_vnops.c
to support sector sizes other than 512 bytes.  (The system still
requires that swap disks have 512-byte sectors.)

Specifications:

	- MC68030 CPU at 16.67 MHz
	- MC68881 floating-point coprocessor
	- 5MB of RAM (could be upgraded to 8MB)
	- 128kB of EPROM, containing boot code
	- 32kB of battery-backed SRAM
	- calendar/clock (DP8570 RTC)
	- 4 serial ports (Z85C30 SCC)
	- SCSI interface (WD33C93A SBIC),
	  connected to 100MB SCSI disk
	- Graphics processor: TMS34010 GSP with 512kB of VRAM,
	  driving a 880 x 600 x 4 bit/pixel display
	- WD1002-05 hard disk/floppy controller,
	  controlling a 45MB hard disk and a 3.5" floppy
	- IDE disk drive (250MB)
	- VME interface (currently not used).

MACHINE for this system is "da30", and MACHINE_ARCH is "m68k".

The port is based largely on the hp300 port, with the exception of the
device drivers and the autoconfiguration code.  I use config.new, and
the autoconfiguration is based on the information in ioconf.c, which
is derived from the config file.

The physical address space of the system is organized as follows:

	00000000 - 007FFFFF	RAM
	00800000 - 0081FFFF	EPROM
	00900000 - 00907FFF	battery-backed SRAM
	00E00000 - 00EFFFFF	I/O space (internal)
	00F00000 - 00F0FFFF	VME A16 address space
	01000000 - FEFFFFFF	VME A32 address space
	FF000000 - FFFFFFFF	VME A24 address space

I/O space is divided into 16 "slots".  Slot n occupies addresses
00En0000 - 00EnFFFF.  Slots are currently assigned as follows:

	0	SCC 1 (serial comms controller)
	1	SCC 2
	4	calendar/clock
	5	WD1002-05 hard + floppy disk ctrler
	6	IDE disk drive
	7	TMS34010 graphics processor
	9	SCSI bus interface controller
