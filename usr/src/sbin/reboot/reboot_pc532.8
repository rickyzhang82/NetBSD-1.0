.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn NetBSD 
kernel, an ordinary executable file,
is placed into chip memory by bootstrap.
Upon startup, the system reorganizes memory to suit the needs of
the hardware configuration found and copies itself to virtual memory,
thus it is not designed to
be restartable without being reloaded on reboot.
Each time it is to be bootstrapped, it must be reloaded, usually from
a disk file.
.Pp
.Sy Rebooting a running system .
When a
.Tn NetBSD
kernel is running and a reboot is desired,
.Xr shutdown 8
is normally used.
If there are no users then
.Nm reboot
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
.Pp
Options to reboot are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
option avoids the sync.  It can be used if a disk or the processor
is on fire. 
.It Fl q

reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down running
processes first.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Reboot
normally logs the reboot using
.Xr syslog 8
and places a shutdown record in the login accounting file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
These actions are inhibited if the
.Fl n
or
.Fl q
options are present.
.Pp
.Sy Cold  starts .
