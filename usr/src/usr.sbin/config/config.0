     CCoonnffiigg builds a set of system configuration files from the file
     _S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E which describes the system to configure.  A second file tells
     ccoonnffiigg what files are needed to generate a system and can be augmented by
     configuration specific set of files that give alternate files for a spe-
     cific machine.  (see the _F_I_L_E_S section below)

     Available option and operand:

     --gg           If the --gg option is supplied, ccoonnffiigg will configure a system
                  for debugging.

     --kk           If the --kk option is supplied, ccoonnffiigg will not fail immedi-
                  ately on detection of a configuration error.

     --pp           If the --pp option is supplied, ccoonnffiigg will configure a system
                  for profiling; for example, kgmon(8) and gprof(1).


     _S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E  specifies the name of the system configuration file contain-
                  ing device specifications, configuration options and other
                  system parameters for one system configuration.

     CCoonnffiigg should be run from the _c_o_n_f subdirectory of the system source
     (usually _/_s_y_s_/_a_r_c_h_/_A_R_C_H_/_c_o_n_f). CCoonnffiigg assumes the directory
     _._._/_c_o_m_p_i_l_e_/_S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E exists and places all output files there.  The
     output of ccoonnffiigg consists of a number of files; for the i386, they are:
     _i_o_c_o_n_f_._c, a description of what I/O devices are attached to the system;
     _v_e_c_t_o_r_._s, a set of interrupt service routines for devices attached to the
     bus plus offsets into a structure used for counting per-device inter-
     rupts; _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, used by make(1) in building the system; header files,
     definitions of the number of various devices that will be compiled into
     the system; swap configuration files, definitions for the disk areas to
     be used for swapping, the root file system, argument processing, and sys-
     tem dumps.

     After running ccoonnffiigg, it is necessary to run ``make depend'' in the di-
     rectory where the new makefile was created.  CCoonnffiigg prints a reminder of
     this when it completes.

     If any other error messages are produced by ccoonnffiigg, the problems in the
     configuration file should be corrected and ccoonnffiigg should be run again.
     Attempts to compile a system that had configuration errors are likely to
     fail.
